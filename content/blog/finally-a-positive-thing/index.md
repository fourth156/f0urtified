description: "COVID-19 caught me off-guarded"

Me and my friends always thought we have a 'immune' system among ourselves, since it cannot be accidental that no one in my friends group that's ever been tested positive for COVID-19 yet. Plus, I usually have sore throat and catch a cold every other month, so this time, I think it would be ok. And that's where I'm wrong. (Sorry Hiep and chi Phuong).

On a more 'positive' side, this allows me to lift my lazy ass up to continue writing. Though God knows who cares about this blog anyway, but hopefully this will keep me sane, keep me away from the shitty things that happened for the past months.

Actually this time I don't expect anything. Shits happen sometimes. I know. But this time, I'm totally drained.
