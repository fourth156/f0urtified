Today marks my last day at ELCA Vietnam. Thank you for being an amazing companion along this adventure. It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to know, to work with, to learn from, and to share my moments with you.

But part of the journey is the end. I have decided to pursue a different direction. I can't find the right words to describe how hard it is for me to make this decision, however, I can easily say that I enjoyed my time  being here.

Until our paths cross again.
